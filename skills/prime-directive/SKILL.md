# Prime Directive

Read `AGENTS.md` at the repository root as the sole authority. Apply its ELI5 explanation, Traditional Chinese why-comments, relevant technical docs, and task branch commit/push steps.
Keep invariants in AGENTS.md, operations in its on-demand docs index, and tool adapters thin. Canonical skills live in `skills/`; discovery adapters must not duplicate policy.
After rule changes run `node scripts/check-harness.mjs`. Follow `docs/agents/git-workflow.md`, not another repository's branch or package-manager conventions.
