# Repository Onboarding

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/AGENT_MAP.md`, then the relevant section of `TECHNICAL.md` and `README.md`.
2. Inspect `package.json` and its npm/package-lock/Vitest commands; preserve the existing service and dashboard toolchains. Use `docs/agents/local-tools.md` for command limits and known baseline failures.
3. Check git status and task ownership. Never inspect credentials or real vault contents for orientation.
4. Trace the target entry point, its callers and nearest contract/test. Do not preload every document or refactor unrelated code.
