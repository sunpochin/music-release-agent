# Supreme Rules / 最高法則
- All LLM agents MUST strictly follow the global coding principles, SOLID patterns, and React architecture guidelines defined in [HANDOFF.md](../HANDOFF.md) and [agent-handoff.md](../docs/agent-handoff.md).
- Any newly generated code must prefer SOLID and state colocation best practices (React components should keep states local unless strictly required to be lifted up to prevent unnecessary tree re-renders).
